## Architectural decisions
I have the most experience in Vue 2, therefore it seemed only logical to use Vue as framework. I haven't used Vue 3 a lot, but since it is the new default i made this application on Vue 3 and learned on to the go.

Vue 3 uses the new tooling Vite in combination with Pinia as state management and Vitest for testing.
